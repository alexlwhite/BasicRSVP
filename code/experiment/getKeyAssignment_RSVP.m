function b = getKeyAssignment_RSVP(task)%Set which keys the program will listen to, and set what each key the%subject can press corrresponds to. % by Alex L White, 2017, at the University of Washington%First, set which keys the subject can press: b.resp = KbName({'z','x','escape'});%Then code what each key means: %Let's say there are 2 stimulus possibilities, and the subject has to%report which one. b.stim1 contains the indices of the keys in b.resp that%the subject should press to report stimulus 1; b.stim2 for stimulus 2. b.stim1 = 1;b.stim2 = 2;%alternatively, the subject's task may be to report whether a target was%present or absent. b.abst and b.pres contain the indices of buttons in%b.resp that the subject could press to report one option or the otherb.abst = 1;b.pres = 2;%which button means quitb.quit = numel(b.resp);%other keys you might need to accessotherKeys = KbName({'space','return'});if task.EYE    otherKeys = [otherKeys KbName({'c','v','d','a','rightArrow'})];  %for calibration, validation, drift correction, auto-thresholdendFlushEvents('keyDown');%Restrict keyboard so nothing works except necessary keysRestrictKeysForKbCheck([b.resp otherKeys]);
